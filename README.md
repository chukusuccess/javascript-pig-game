ALL FILES FOR THIS PROJECT ARE COMPLETE, EVEN THE FLOWCHART PNG FILE IS INCLUDED.
THE GAME LOGIC IS THIS:
THE ACTIVE PLAYER CAN ROLL THE DIE CONTINUOUSLY AND KEEP ACCUMULATING HIS SCORE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER ON THE DIE FACE THAT HE ROLLED, UNTIL A ONE(1) IS ROLLED.
ONCE THE ACTIVE PLAYER ROLLS A ONE(1), HE LOSES ALL ACCUMULATED SCORE AND THEN TURN SWITCHES TO THE NEXT PLAYER.
THE WAY TO NOT LOSE YOUR ACCUMULATED SCORE IS TO HOLD THE SCORE AND SURRENDER TURN TO PLAYER TWO.
THE FIRST PLAYER TO ACCUMULATE UP TO A HUNDRED, WINS THE GAME
